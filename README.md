Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed? You can test your logical thinking while having fun doing it.

Market: How large or unique is the market for this app? Massive brainteaser gaming market and large niche for logic puzzle games e.g. Brainzilla, Math is Fun, Puzzle Dell Puzzles.

Habit Usage most likely daily or few times a week, possible d/t chasing better scores and more difficult challenges.

Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app? V1 Would provide a simple easy game with basic scale progression, keep track of score/level, screen for winning and losing. V2 Adds on hard mode (more complex puzzles), possible sounds/animation when complete a stage or level. V3 Adds on a timers(9 secs) for each move, possible additional puzzle themes.

### Inspiration
We’re a team that loves making people think and have fun while they do it. One of us is all about designing cool game worlds and mechanics, and the other can’t resist a good logic puzzle. Together, we want to create games that spark curiosity, challenge the brain, and give players that “aha!” moment that keeps them coming back for more.
